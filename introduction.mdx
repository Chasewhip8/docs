How it came to be: We were messing around checking out the pumpfun craze and ended up launching a coin with out bots completely decimating it. Great we made it off of pump, now what? Lets make a protocol with the strict goal of building the “why hasn't anyone built this yet” products.

## What the fuck is a memeprotocol?

We intend to build things, not knowing exactly how it will play out but we will test in prod no matter how good or bad the idea is, thus the name memeprotocol. BSC will be a playground for devs to try new things

## Our Products - Ever evolving
